<h1>Week 2, lecture 1:<br></h1>
The main theme in today's lecture was optimisation and how careful analysis of seemingly elegant algorithms reveals obvious flaws. Our subject today was the problem of finding the n<sup>th</sup> Fibonacci number. While the algorithms discussion closely followed the textbook, we were able to talk about hidden pitfalls in designing algorithms, like the use of memory in memoisation, how not all operations are atomic, and how computers can't always perform every mathematical method precisely (eg. using expressions of irrational numbers).

As extra reading this week I read up detailed explanations of Karatsuba's multiplication algorithms and a little bit about Fast Fourier transforms as hinted at in class. Namely, videos about the Fourier transform itself.

<h1>Week 2, lecture 2:<br></h1>
In todays lecture we covered our first technique to improve on algorithms; divide and conquer.
This technique aims to try and use recursion to split a problem into multiple smaller and easier to manage problems of the same type, and
merging their solutions after solving them recursively. Since recurrence relationships are commonly encountered when trying to calculate the 
time complexity of recursive algorithms, we first covered the 'Master theorem' and its proof. Aptly named, it is a generalisation of the simplest type of 
reccurence relation that could be encountered:<br> T(n) = aT(n/b) + O(n^d)<br>
The later examples provided examples of practical applications of divide and conquer, use of the master theorem and called back to the three questions about algorithms we discussed in earlier lectures. The discussion on merge-sort also gave us an example of a proof of optimality. The Strassen's algo example called back to Gauss' optimisation of finding the product of complex numbers and also gave us an example of a still open problem. The discussion on the selection problem (while already discussed in last years DSA course) was an opportunity to revise previously covered concepts and gave us insight into the thought process of a computer scientist optimising an algorithm. <br>
Clustered assignments only let me revise the portion covered so far as extra reading.
