<h1>Week 1, lecture 1:<br></h1>
This lecture was our introduction to the algorithms course, and in other ways an introductions to thinking about computation as theoretical. We spent a large portion of the lecture talking about what defines a computational problem, eventually concluding that they can be defined as decision problems on languages. The later examples comparinging some 'generic' computation problems developed on the concept of languages in general. Sir also talked about the three 'axioms' of computation and how they limit current algorithms. We ended the lecture talking about solutions to problems can be compared to each other based on the resources they use and why computer scientists value time above all else.
This lecture prompted me to learn more about the early days of computation theory and read more about the works of Alan Turing. I learnt about Turing machines and some currently ongoing problems regarding them like the Busy beaver problem.

<h1>Week 1, lecture 2:<br></h1>
Today, we talked about unsolvable problems.
We made more abstractions, this time of problems and programs. Using the fact that uncountable infinities are larger than countable ones, the fact that problems can be classified as languages and a clever idea of converting programs to binary strings, we concluded that there must be computational problems that cant be solved with any program, with the constraint that programs have to be finite (as this would violate the 'omnipresence' axiom discussed in the previous lecture). This lectures extra work consisted of me further reading the textbook and more reading up about the use of Turing machines.
